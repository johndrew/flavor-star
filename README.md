# Flavor Star
Utility to create recipes based on flavor compliments and contracts

## Background / Inspiration
I found the Flavor Star diagram on [CookSmarts.com](https://www.cooksmarts.com/articles/study-flavor-profiles/), and really liked how it categorized and compared different flavors. I had been looking for more empirical information about cooking (rather than a recipe in blog-post format) so I could understand cooking techniques on a deeper level.
